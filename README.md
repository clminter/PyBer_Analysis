# PyBer_Analysis
### Overview
##### Analyze ride sharing data for PyBer in 2019 to include:
- Total Rides
- Total Drivers
- Total Fares
- Average Fare/Ride
- Average Fare/Driver

##### for a large set of urban, suburban and rural cities.

#### Challenges:
##### Using Matplotlib to create multiple chart types:
- Line Charts:

- Bar Charts with Standard Deviation:

### Results
##### Though total rides are significantly lower in rural areas, the average fare per driver is significantly higher. And not coincidentally, the number drivers is much lower in these areas. It is interesting to note that average fare per ride in these rural areas is not overwhelmingly higher than the suburban areas. See summary data frame below:

##### It is also interesting to note the peaks and valleys of fare pricing throughout each month and the lack of correlation between the city types.

### Summary
##### There is a clear disparity among city types, especially as it relates to average fare per driver. There is great demand in urban areas, but this demand is being fulfilled by too many drivers thereby driving down the average fare per driver. In fact, there are more drivers than rides.
##### Recommendations are:
- Significantly reduce the number of drivers in urban areas.
- Increase the number of drivers in rural areas.
- Monitor the suburban areas in order to keep the ratio of drivers to rides between 75-80%.
